-get rid of all "magic" weapon meshes
-make inf ammo UpdateHudAmmo display a pct proportional to the mana (a list in player)
	->diminishes as long as attack held
	->increases if recharging flag is set
-Display the spell name in the mana bar

:::HOW TO REFERENCE CODE VARIABLES:::
-give the ammo gui a different color for magic weapons?
	->set the specific color variable in the UpdateHudAmmo?
-pulse the color if recharging (see where pulsing is set in the .gui)...is it? armor?


-all spells go through the lightning gun
-different effects different behavior => but conditionals on the IN-CODE behavior and reference different spawnArgs and damageDef stuff accordingly
-different FX

spell_mana_%i
spell_recharge_%i

fx_spell_%i
fx_spell_derp_%i
