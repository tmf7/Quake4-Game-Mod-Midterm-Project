keep the rockets effects active after it comes to rest
use the residual_time (total duration of extra damages) and delay_residual (delays the occurance of the next splash damage) values (as seen in naplam projectile) and def_residual_damage

af.GetPhysics()->SetTimeScaleRamp( slomoStart, slomoEnd ); ( in idActor::StartRagdoll ) intended to slow the progression of events
	could be useful for slowing an explosion???


determine viable entities to paralyze in radius
check if the entity is a monster (and not just a shitty ZOMBIE HUSK)
checks the monster mass property (if a monster has something like that)
depending on mass set: ragdoll or stagger or die
