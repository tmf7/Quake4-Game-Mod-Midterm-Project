boss health bar display during boss blattle (modify that box and its linked variable)
idPlayer::StartBossBattle

player.cpp
	// FIXME: this is temp to allow the sound meter to show up in the hud
	// it should be commented out before shipping but the code can remain
	// for mod developers to enable for the same functionality
	_hud->SetStateInt( "s_debug", cvarSystem->GetCVarInteger( "s_showLevelMeter" ) );

printing a message to the console???
from projectile.cpp
common->DPrintf( "Projectile collision no impact\n" );

for necromancer:
aifl.dead = false;
idAI::CheckForTeammateEnemy( void )
idAI::CheckForEnemy ( bool useFov, bool force )
idAI::FindEnemy ( bool inFov, bool forceNearest, float maxDistSqr )
	

if ( ReactionTo( player ) & ATTACK_ON_ACTIVATE ) {
	SetEnemy( player );
}
idAI::ReactionTo( const idEntity *ent ) //checks what team the AI is on 

EXTRA: when casting magic place different color QUAD DAMAGE auras on player
interupts the State_Dead countdown to burn
gives the entity health
unragdolls them (as per paralysis bombs)
tether's them to the player as a friendly 
marks it as an enemy of the enemies (like the NPC followers are)
