boss health bar display during boss blattle (modify that box and its linked variable)
idPlayer::StartBossBattle

player.cpp
	// FIXME: this is temp to allow the sound meter to show up in the hud
	// it should be commented out before shipping but the code can remain
	// for mod developers to enable for the same functionality
	_hud->SetStateInt( "s_debug", cvarSystem->GetCVarInteger( "s_showLevelMeter" ) );

printing a message to the console???
from projectile.cpp
common->DPrintf( "Projectile collision no impact\n" );




idPlayer::Weapon_Combat updates the hud information and fires the weapon based on player BUTTON_ATTACK
also use EvaluateControls in the idPlayer::Think()
