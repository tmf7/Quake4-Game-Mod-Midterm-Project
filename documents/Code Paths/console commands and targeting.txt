*****looking for how/what my followers/team target and attack enemies********

idAI::ReactionTo( const idEntity *ent )
idAI::OnEnemyChange ( idEntity* oldEnemy )

	enemy.fl.inFov		= false;
	enemy.fl.visible	= false;

idAI::CheckActions ( void )

idAI::CheckAction_RangedAttack ( rvAIAction* action, int animNum )
lastKnownPosition

every AI has one enemy

IK seems to be the class the manipulates an AF's bones to produce specific manual animations

I want to debug show (if possible) the bounding boxes of the af physics and the ent physics

________________________________________________________________________
useful console commands thus far:

spawn monster_strogg_marine
g_dragEntity (telekinesis and possibly real-time map editing when spawn is used)
g_showHud (make this code display for thirdperson..it currently doesnt when enabled, the hud includes the crossair)
g_showPlayerShadow (find this code, it determines the light level and orientation probably maybe)
[g_showDebugHud (not sure what this does because it displays a black screen and error right now, but can easily be switched to normal)]
[g_editEntityMode (meh, cant seem to do much in this, see the code to verify)]
[g_showGodDamage (see the code, it shoud display a hud number, but it doesn't right now, possibly magic meter help here)]

g_showCollisionWorld (displays the WORLD collision objects/clipmodels)
g_showCollisionModels (shows essentially the AI collision models be they pure bounding box or AF)
g_showClipSectors (shows how the world is broken down for sectors and quick collision detection)
g_showEntityInfo (if forget, not too useful I think...double check maybe)

g_showTargets (shows tethers and the like)
[g_showTriggers (meh, shows scripted events basically)]

g_showEnemies (shows enemies of the player, not exactly their bounding box, but close)
