explode calls the RadiusDamage/ResidualDamage function in gamelocal
it plays the explosion sound (leaky pipe sound would be better)
it plays the explosion graphic (not on a loop)
//it alerts the AI about the owner
it puts the physics object to rest and clears its clipmodel contents
it hides the graphics, frees the lightEntity
it stops the fly_fx /*AND all other particle effects (StopAllEffects( );) FIZZLE DOESNT*/ (so does....Think() before explode)
then it removes the projectile

it seems to set the axis (opposite of gravity if at rest, velocity if not) and origin of the fx ***PlayDetonateEffect( endpos, fxDir.ToMat3() );
it also seems to set the origin of the hidden projectile a large amount in the opposte direction of its point of impact (weird???)


find "fx_impact"

idState???

AI_PlayAnim -> Event_PlayAnim

PerformAction ( "Torso_Pain", 2, true );
idProjectile::PlayPainEffect??

im currently trying to:
-fix lastKnowPosition errors (along with clipmodel/combatmodel jumping)
	->ONLY idAI thinks when something is ragdolled
	->working through idAI::Think() to determine where the af and entiry physics object/clipmodel diverge
	-currently (both the aifl for think and physics are set as normal, physics only cuts off when the ragdoll is at rest)
	->looking through the THINK section to determine blah...

_________________________________________________

focus on the rocket launcher:
-Launch behavior (disable fuses)
-Collide behavior (bounce, never explode, do some direct damage on bounce maybe)
-think behavior (check if at rest -> start cloud)
-Explode behavior (NEVER SHOULD)
-FIzzle behavior (always should)
-Paralysis_Cloud Behavior (recursive call)
-RadiusDamage behavior
