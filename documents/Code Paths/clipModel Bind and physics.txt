idClip::Link() sets the dynamicContents of all its clipSectors[] according to the contents of the clipModel it ...somthing
A clipmodel has a mask and contents, the mask includes type flags (projectile, etc), the content includes the material (solid, body, etc)

A clipmodel can be linked to sectors via clipLinks:
	radius damage gathers all the sectors in the bounds of the explosion radius (from the origination point)
	checks all the cliplinks for each sector to determine their validity (already checked, enabled, empty contents)
	THEN it checks to ensure the bounding boxes of each model actually does overlap the bounding box of the explosion


A sector's dynamicContents would be zero if nothing were linked to it OR if the clipLinks' clipmodels had 0 content when originally linked
