-go through the logic of COLLIDE as to why a thing that strikes a particular object immedialy plays a detonate/impact effect
	->regardless of whether it's bouncy

-FORCE DMG TO ALWAYS PLAY RELOAD EACH SHOT

-Fix NPC crossair (originally wanted to prevent them from ragdoll using that code)

-make flashbang ai blindness last alot longer
-un-nerf necromancer


____________________________________________________
Silenced PISTOL:

idPlayer::UpdateHudStats
wfl.silent_fire (to avoid alerting nearby AIs)
idPlayer::SetShowHUD( bool );
idPlayer::ShowCrosshair

focusLength (something calculates the distance to what essentially the first person crosshair is aimed at)

owner->playerView.SetShakeParms( MS2SEC(gameLocal.GetTime() + 500), 2.0f ); //shaky camera

g_editEntityMode (click on an entity/whatever to SELECT and edit it in-game)


___________________________________________________________
MAGIC STEPS:
-Enable IMPULSE_24 (bind 'v') to set the spell # (and update the hud accordingly)
	->a version of the lighting gun with and without a model???????
-Setup Weapon_Combat to cast the spell

-ensure the player starts off with all four spells
-ensure that when a spell runs out it stays equipped just fine but cant fire

-make a single mana bar that displays like the ammo clip on the hud (just far to the right or top or wherever) and updatehudstats accordingly
	->make the bar blink if its reloading...forget this shit about not even going to it or switching away
	->have it display the spell name instead of the mana_amount number (like bullets in clip)

As long as BUTTON_ATTACK IS HELD:
Think->UpdateWeapon->Weapon_Combat->FireWeapon->( weapon->BeginAttack )->wsfl.attack = true (weapon animates/attacks)


->after a weapon spawns the Think() function of the lightninggun just waits for wsfl.attack == true to actually do the magic
