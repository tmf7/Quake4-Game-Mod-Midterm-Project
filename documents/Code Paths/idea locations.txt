the grenade is a projectile

modify what happens when it explodes (change the enemy to a follower that fights with you)

AI_states sets the state of an enemy to agressive or passive

damageDefName = spawnArgs.GetString ( "def_damage" );
actualHitEnt (in projectile)

projectiles and/or entities do have a "sticky" member variable, but its never used in the code of vanilla quake...use collide?

Think function
Monster.cpp
camera.cpp
player.cpp/h

check/change what the Save function for a class does to see whats easiest to modify

does the player.cpp need to know how much light is on its model?
how does the monster detect the player


//debug console printout
gameLocal.Printf( "Spawn id %d: %d\n", i, gameLocal.spawnIds[ i ] );

g_debugDamage is a idCVar
