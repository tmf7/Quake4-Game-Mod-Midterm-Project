	"#str_300422"	"{furrow}Kane, find Sergeant Bidwell immediately."

	"#str_300651"	"{pain}It pains me that we must destroy this Strogg facility. {idle}The knowledge we could gain by studying it."

	"#str_300660"	"Glad you gentlemen could make it. Listen up, Marines. We need to locate the console thatll open up the hatchways and allow the convoy through."
	"#str_300661"	"All clear."

	"#str_300663"	"{confused}What the hell was that?"

	"#str_300667"	"{furrow}Yes . . . well . . . I would have done that."
	"#str_300668"	"All right, convoy. Open the hatchways and advance."

	"#str_300672"	"Okay . . . {confused}so what do we do?"
	"#str_300673"	"I must find the console that controls life support. From there, I should be able to raise the temperature to something a little less hostile."

	"#str_300687"	"{furrow}Corporal Kane, you should have been here a long time ago! {idle}But we will speak of this later. Right now, we must concern ourselves with the Nexus. To destroy the Tetranode we must overheat it and that will require several steps. Our first objective is the power plant. Lead the way."
	"#str_300688"	"Please, let me open the doors. I can do it without activating security alarms."
	"#str_300689"	"Corporal Kane, go to the console over there and I will use this one. We must activate them in the correct sequence so as not to alert security. I will wait for you to activate yours first."

	"#str_300692"	"{furrow}Corporal Kane, activate the other console! We do not have much time."
	"#str_300693"	"There. Now I will raise the power plant output and that will cause a heat buildup."
	"#str_300694"	"Next we must disable the emergency shutoff or it will deactivate the Tetranode at the first sign of danger."
	"#str_300695"	"{happy}Ah! A primary console. {idle}Exactly what I was searching for. This allows me to monitor all systems. I must remain here but I will guide you through the rest of our mission. You will have to go on without me."

	"#str_300711"	"Corporal Kane, I have taken you to the proper cable bundle. Activate the splicing arms. They will disable communication between the emergency shutoff and the Tetranode."
	"#str_300712"	"I trust the wire bundle nearby has melted through? That means emergency shutoff has been deactivated. Now you must locate the next maintenance platform. From there I will take you to an area near the coolant pumps. Then you will be able to destroy the Tetranode."
	"#str_300713"	"Well done. You have arrived at the next maintenance platform. I will now steer you to the next area."
	"#str_300714"	"The ride is over, Corporal Kane. Now you must locate the coolant pumps. Go, quickly."

	"#str_301116"	"Correct. Intelligence believes that because of his Strogg physiology, Kane is the only one who can deactivate the security stations. Kane, you most likely are our last, best hope of destroying the Nexus."
	"#str_301117"	"Strauss, we'll need your expertise at the Networking tower once we gain control."

	"#str_301366"	"There's some type of intelligence that's actually inside the Nexus. If Strauss weren't so fast, the entity would have locked us out of the Nexus long ago."

	"#str_301400"	"I can see now why they wanted me to protect Strauss. I'm not sure who wants him dead more, the Strogg or the humans. But he does indeed possess the unique skills to hack into the Strogg Nexus."
	"#str_301401"	"While Strauss has always lacked people skills, the strain he is under shows him at his worst."
	"#str_301402"	"With the way Strauss is ordering everyone around, you'd think he was a General... a very temperamental General."

	"#str_301637"	"Greetings, Corporal Rhodes. You must locate the security interface. There is one in each terminal that must be disabled to gain access to the Core. But be careful, only Corporal Kane can use it."
	"#str_301638"	"Will do. Rhodes out. {furrow}You heard the man, let's find that security station."
	"#str_301639"	"{confused}I wonder how the rest of our squad is doing? {idle}I think everyone got off the Hannibal in one piece."
	"#str_301640"	"Last I saw of Strauss, he was surrounded by about fifty Marine bodyguards. He also got a big group of techs, bowing and scraping to him. {happy}It's the happiest I ever seen him."

	"#str_301643"	"Soldier, I gave you an order! Find a way to open the hangars door now!"

	"#str_301648"	"This is Falcon one, what's the hold up? This zone is hot and I need to land!"
	"#str_301649"	"That heat source is moving rapidly towards the hangar. Whatever it is, you can bet it isn't friendly."

	"#str_301651"	"Falcon one has landed. Troops are being deployed. Shit, something's under the hangar floor."
	"#str_301652"	"Shit. It's trying to beat it's way through. Immediate dust off in..."
	"#str_301653"	"A Strogg creature just tore through the hangar floor like it was wet cardboard. It's huge. I estimate thirty feet tall. We're taking heavy casualties."

	"#str_301655"	"Nothing's slowing it down!"
	"#str_301656"	"Locked. The Strogg must have sealed off all access to the elevators. Huh. {happy}I got a little something that'll clear it away."
	"#str_301657"	"Stand back."
	"#str_301658"	"{furrow}Back up, Kane. You're too close to the explosives."
	"#str_301659"	"{furrow}Kane, I can't fire the explosives with you standing there."

	"#str_301661"	"{happy}Ha. They ain't no door that a little compressed Comptazine won't unlock. Let's roll."
	"#str_301662"	"Ho, man, this is incredible. Would you look at all this?"
	"#str_301663"	"{happy}Shit, I think I can see my house from here."
	"#str_301664"	"Lets get you to that security interface at the top of this tower."
	"#str_301665"	"Well done, Corporal Kane! The Core security interface from Data Storage is disabled. Corporal Rhodes, you should remain there and guard the console in case the Strogg should attempt to reactivate it. Corporal Kane should locate the tram and take it to the Data Processing Tower. There he will have to deactivate the second security station at the top. Strauss out."
	"#str_301666"	"Damn, that man's about as warm as a bag of ice. Well, you better get goin', Kane. See ya around."
	"#str_301667"	"Go on now. Don't worry about me. You're the only one who can activate the security consoles at the tops of the towers."
	"#str_301668"	"{furrow}Kane, come on. Haul ass to the Strogg tram. You have to get to the Process tower."
	"#str_301669"	"{furrow}amn it, Kane. Get out of here. You're needed at the Process tower."

	"#str_301677"	"Why? Why would the Strogg do this?"

	"#str_301683"	"Kane, this is Hollenbeck. Good job, the T S D's are being redeployed. Now get back up here on the double."
	"#str_301684"	"Wish all our missions were this easy. Hey, what's that?"
	"#str_301685"	"This wasn't such a tough mission. Hmm, what's that doing?"

	"#str_301691"	"Thanks for the assist, Kane. We were dropped into an ambush."
	"#str_301692"	"Yeah, you musta seen what the bastards did to the rest of our squad. Now were just trying to get out of here."
	"#str_301693"	"Kane, youre probably looking to get to the next tower. Come with us. We have orders to secure the bridge control center. From there you can catch a tram at the hub a couple of clicks away."
	"#str_301694"	"{happy}Hear that . . . . thats our ride out of this hell hole!"
	"#str_301695"	"{scared}Shit! Its a Strogg transport! Look out!"

	"#str_301702"	"Okay, Kane. Head upstairs and find a way to extend the bridge to the hub area. We'll stay here and guard your back."
	"#str_301703"	"Kane. You are lucky I recognized you. We were ambushed and the men are scattered. So I will accompany you. Lead the way."
	"#str_301704"	"Lieutanant Morris, this is Cortez again. I am nearing the tram hub but it will still be a while before I make it to the Processing Tower."
	"#str_301705"	"I copy that. Just get to there as soon as you can. Morris, out."
	"#str_301706"	"The tram I was in took a direct hit from a rocket. I was knocked out of the car, but I managed to find safety."

	"#str_301709"	"Hello, Kane. You are quite lucky I didnt shoot when I first had that Strogg face of yours in my crosshairs. But then, had I killed you, I would have lost the bet with Rhodes. And that would not do."
	"#str_301710"	"I am on my way to the Processing Tower, {puzzled}why don't you accompany me? But before we can proceed this tram must be rotated in the proper direction and the track must be repaired. Search around and see what you can do."
	"#str_301711"	"This tram can't take much more abuse."
	"#str_301712"	"{furrow}Damn it, Kane. Do something!"
	"#str_301713"	"We are so screwed."
	"#str_301714"	"{furrow}Was I hit? Do you see any blood?"
	"#str_301715"	"Shit, there's nothing I can do. We've gotta sit and wait until  that tram car goes by. Keep the Strogg off our backs until the track clears."
	"#str_301716"	"{furrow}About damn time. Let me get this crate moving again."
	"#str_301717"	"Good job, Kane. The tram is now facing the right direction. Return to the tram and we can be on our way."
	"#str_301718"	"Good job, Kane. The tram is now facing the right direction. But you still need to find a way to repair the track."
	"#str_301719"	"Excellent, Kane. The track has been repaired. Return to the tram and we can be on our way."
	"#str_301720"	"Excellent, Kane. The track has been repaired. But now you must find some way to turn the tram so that it faces the right direction."
	"#str_301721"	"I must apologize for the condition of this tram. It has been damaged and will not run at full speed."
	"#str_301722"	"This is where my squad was ambushed. The track was damaged so I had to head back alone. The tech guy in my squad said the Strogg should have some type of repair bots around here to fix  the break. Lets try to find em."
	"#str_301723"	"Wait! Wait! This is Corporal Kane."

	"#str_301759"	"I trust we do not have much further to go."
	"#str_301760"	"Of all the... I missed the switch! That track to the left would have taken us to the Processing tower. Now we must take this entire track around again."
	"#str_301761"	"Kane, look! That flier is going to crash!"
	"#str_301762"	"It hit the fuel lines! We cannot move any further. Find a way to shut off the lines and stop the fire."

	"#str_303594"	"Kane, this is Morris. The demolitionist should be near the top of the elevator."

	"#str_303596"	"Listen up, Marines. Were looking to get below the Tetranode, the brains of this facility, and destroy it with our E M P bomb. Once thats accomplished, the Strogg lines of communication will be cut and our troops will have an easy time of it.

	"#str_303601"	"You assign me only one guard? Must I die to show you how valuable I am? Never mind. This way, Corporal Kane."
	"#str_303602"	"Be extremely cautious, Corporal. We do not want to attract that Harvesters attention."
	"#str_303603"	"Ah, yes. Precisely what I was looking for. Give me a moment."

	"#str_303612"	"Have one of the techs there use the commands I am downloading to you now. By entering these into the primary servos, the hatchway will open."
	"#str_303613"	"Lieutenant Voss, I must complain. Corporal Kane is taking far too long to reach me. "

	"#str_303628"	"Let us return to the Tetranode. From there we must find a way to disable the emergency shutoff. If we take too long, the shutoff will sense the heat buildup and deactivate all systems."
	"#str_303629"	"Before we can disable the emergency shutoff, we must locate the Visual Processing area. Let us take the elevator to the second floor. We should be able to find it there."

	"#str_303632"	"Hey, Strauss, Kane. Just to give you an update, the squad is still alive. Were still trapped but Lieutenant Voss is working on a plan. How are you doin?"
	"#str_303633"	"Despite Corporal Kanes tendency to dawdle, we are making good progress."
	"#str_303634"	"Okay, Morris, give the word!"
	"#str_303635"	"Move out, Marines! Go! Go!! GO!!!"
	"#str_303636"	"Were currently working our way back towards the vehicle elevator. Its slow going but were gaining ground. Whats your situation, Strauss?"
	"#str_303637"	"Had I known Corporal Kane would work this slowly, I would have accompanied him to speed things up. But we are making reasonable progress."
	"#str_303638"	"Okay. Keep me informed."

	"#str_303640"	"Get a medic over there, now!"
	"#str_303641"	"The ride is over, Corporal Kane. You must now return to the Tetranode room. Locate another maintenance platform to take you back there."

	"#str_303643"	"Were not leaving you behind, sir."
	"#str_303644"	"Damn straight youre not. Cortez and I are going to give you cover. Then well be up."
	"#str_303645"	"So far you have done well, Corporal Kane. Your final task will be to shut down the coolant pumps. This will cause a complete meltdown of the Tetranode."
	"#str_303646"	"Okay, Strauss. Were holding a position just outside the facility. Let us know when you want us to come get you."
	"#str_303647"	"It will be as soon as Corporal Kane deactivates the coolant pumps. And at his pace, it could take hours."
	"#str_303648"	"Strauss, this is Voss. Whats your situation?"

	"#str_303664"	"When I left the Hannibal for the Processing Tower, I was one of eight men. They were new recruits, all eager for combat, certain the others would die and they alone would live. I, on the other hand, was willing to die to protect them."
	"#str_303665"	"It is ironic that I am the only one who still draws breath, isnt it, Kane?"
	"#str_303666"	"You have perhaps heard rumors that I killed a Strogg without a weapon. The story is true. It happened during the Strogg invasion of Earth."
	"#str_303667"	"The previous commander of Rhino squad, Lieutenant Wells, had been hurt, as had I. I was forced to drop my weapon so that I could carry the Lieutenant out."

	"#str_303687"	" I . . . I do not know. The technology is quite advanced."
	"#str_303688"	"But I'm sure after a few minutes of study it would be easy to understand."

	"#str_303690"	"That must be all that remains of Cougar squad."
	"#str_303691"	"We are almost there, Kane."
	"#str_303692"	"Do you hear that Kane? That is the sound of hundreds of Marines landing on this tower. We must be sure to leave them a few Strogg to kill."
	"#str_303693"	"Cougar Squad must be landing."
	"#str_303694"	"I'm sure Strauss would enjoy studying this facility."
	"#str_303695"	"Strauss would have a field day here."
	"#str_303696"	"This is the elevator to the roof. Get ready."
	"#str_303697"	"This is no time to sight see. Lets go, Kane."
	"#str_303698"	"Come along, Kane. We must follow the data stream."
	"#str_303699"	"Here. I scavanged this off a dead Strogg. I bet it'd work on your lightning weapon. It looks powerful enough to overload the personal shields some of the Strogg use."
	"#str_303700"	"Lets head back outside and sweep the area. Weve gotta secure the bridge. Kane, you lead."
	"#str_303701"	"Thanks for the help, Kane. Weve got orders to keep this bridge secured. You can go on to the processing tower."
	"#str_303702"	"I am on my way to the Processing Tower, why dont you accompany me? But before we can proceed this tram must be rotated in the proper direction."
	"#str_303703"	"Many men died to get us this far, Kane. We must take control of the Process Tower at all costs."
	"#str_303704"	"Excellent. This looks to be the hub control room. See if you can find some way to rotate the tram from here."
	"#str_303705"	"Very good, Kane. The tram is now facing the right direction, but it appears the track is damaged."
	"#str_303706"	"There is a door leading to a construction site below the tram. Head there and locate some repair bots to fix the track. I will remain here and guard the tram."
	"#str_303707"	"Excellent, Kane. The track has been repaired. Return to the tram and we can be on our way to the process tower."
	"#str_303708"	"We need to find a way to get up to the second floor."
	"#str_303709"	"Kane, stay there. I will be right up."
	"#str_303710"	"Hurry up, Kane. We must keep moving."
	"#str_303711"	"You have no idea how difficult it was to liberate this tram. I ran several miles, from station to station, but they were all either empty or the trams were wrecked."
	"#str_303712"	"I even began toying with the idea of interrogating the Strogg, using Strauss as an interpreter."
	"#str_303713"	"Then I chanced upon a station that had this tram we are riding in now. Unfortunately it was protected by several squads of Strogg."
	"#str_303714"	"Luckily, the Strogg were not as proficient with a gun as me. I have fired more rounds today than I have in the past 2 months , and you know how I am about wasting ammunition."
	"#str_303715"	"Those fuel lines have ruptured! We cannot move any further until you find a way to shut off the lines and stop the fire."
	"#str_303716"	"Do not stop, Kane! I will keep them off you!"
	"#str_303717"	"Keep going! I will not let them hurt you."
	"#str_303718"	"Watch your step."
	"#str_303719"	"Be careful, Kane. There are more coming!"
	"#str_303720"	"Do not slow down, whatever you do."
	"#str_303721"	"Kane, this is H Q. You just picked up a weapons upgrade. Now if you zoom in with your nail gun, the nails will attempt to follow the target. Youll find its great for shooting around corners."

	"#str_303723"	"Sorry we have orders to stay here. You should find your squad."

	"#str_303760"	"Kane did an adequate job executing my plan."
	"#str_303761"	"Humble to the end Strauss. Kane's actions have sent the Strogg forces into disarray."
	"#str_303762"	"Remember your primary goal is to locate and destroy the Nexus. That will disable the Strogg communication network."
	"#str_303763"	"You are about to enter the room that houses the Nexus, Corporal Kane. Watch yourself, no doubt it will be heavily guarded."
	"#str_303764"	"This is Private Sasaki. The Strogg are attempting to corner me at the Dispersal facility. Please, I need immediate assistance."
	"#str_303765"	"Viper Squad, this is Morris. H Qs finally located a demolitionist for the hangars. He should be there soon."

	"#str_303770"	"Ah, very good. This appears to be the control room."
	"#str_303771"	"I must find the temperature controls. From there, I should be able to make the atmosphere a little less hostile."
	"#str_303772"	"{furrow}I demand you protect me!"

	"#str_303774"	"Lieutenant Voss, I must remain here and maintain the temperature controls or the areaa will return to its frigid state."
	"#str_303775"	"Kane, check that door. The shutoff to the forcefield might be in there."
	"#str_303776"	"Lieutenant Voss, this is Strauss. What has happened?"
	"#str_303777"	"Calm down, Strauss. I'm sure Kane's moving as fast as he can."
	"#str_303778"	"The entire facility is centered around this room. We need to find the power plant. Lead the way."
	"#str_303779"	"Ah, these are the controls to the power plant."
	"#str_303780"	"Let us return to the Tetranode. From there we must find a way to disable the emergency shutoff. If we don't disable it, it will detect the heat buildup and deactivate all systems."
	"#str_303781"	"We can disable the emergency shutoff from the Visual Processing area. Let us take the elevator to the second floor. There we should be able to find it."
	"#str_303782"	"{happy}Ah! The emergency shut off controls."
	"#str_303783"	"The area you are in stretches between all facilities in this complex."
	"#str_303784"	"Corporal Kane, you should now be at the emergency shutoff relays. Use the splicing controls to cut the cable in front of you. That will disable the emergency shutoff system and allow us to overheat the Tetranode."

	"#str_303801"	"The storage system should set the barrels up for us. Why don't you go find a way to activate it and I'll stay here and monitor you?"
	"#str_303802"	"I just hit the mother load of Strogg data on this computer. Now if I can just figure out how to use it."
	"#str_303803"	"Great. Looks like the whole system needs to be rebooted. You're gonna have to locate and restart both the sterilization and assembly subsystems."
	"#str_303804"	"Greetings, Corporal Rhodes. You must locate the security interfaces. There is one at the top of each tower that must be disabled to gain access to the Core. But be careful, only Corporal Kane can access them."

	"#str_303884"	"I'll have you patched up in no time."
	"#str_303885"	"There. Finished. Now try to be more careful."
	"#str_303890"	"Nice job, Kane."
	"#str_303891"	"Hey, Kane. You better take this with you."
	"#str_303892"	"Hey, Kane. Come here."
	"#str_303893"	"Kane, you gotta go."
	"#str_303894"	"C'mon, Kane. Follow me."
	"#str_303895"	"Very nice, Kane."
	"#str_303896"	"You will need this, Kane. Take it."
	"#str_303897"	"Corporal Kane, please come here."
	"#str_303898"	"You will want to get going, Kane."
	"#str_303899"	"Kane, please follow me."
	"#str_303900"	"Well done, Kane."
	"#str_303901"	"Watch it, Kane!"
	"#str_303902"	"Take this, Corporal Kane. It should be most useful."
	"#str_303903"	"Corporal Kane, come here now."
	"#str_303904"	"Corporal Kane, you must proceed."
	"#str_303905"	"You must follow me, Corporal Kane."
	"#str_303906"	"Corporal Kane."
	"#str_303907"	"Good, Corporal Kane."
	"#str_303908"	"Watch yourself, Corporal Kane!"
	"#str_303909"	"Strogg to your left!"
	"#str_303910"	"Here, Kane. You’ll need this."
	"#str_303911"	"Kane. Come here."
	"#str_303912"	"Kane, head out in that direction."
	"#str_303913"	"Kane, you're with me. Let's go."
	"#str_303914"	"Kane, over here!"
	"#str_303915"	"Heads up, Kane."
	"#str_303916"	"You're Kane, right? My name's Anderson. Here let me heal you. "
	"#str_303917"	"If you get hurt, find a medic. They'll heal you up."
	"#str_303918"	"Our squad's already left. Go see Morris over there for orders."
	"#str_303919"	"I'm too late. He's dead. There was nothing I could do."
	"#str_303920"	"Damn it all. Bidwell was a good man... a good Marine."
	"#str_303921"	"Strauss, the E M P's destroyed but we still have to shutdown this facility. Any ideas?"
	"#str_303922"	"Ja. But it means I have to go directly to the Tetranode."
	"#str_303923"	"All right. Kane's the only one who's uninjured, so he's going with you."
	"#str_303924"	"If my memory of the building schematics is correct, Kane must take a crawlway out and I will meet him at the other end."
	"#str_303925"	"Sounds like a plan. Voss out."
	"#str_303926"	"Kane, I don't need to tell you how important this is. Whatever the cost, you must destroy the Tetranode and bring down the Nexus."
	"#str_303927"	"I just upped the field output by 300 percent. Now that rail gun is gonna really kick ass.  You'll be able to shoot straight through guys."
	"#str_303928"	"Let me see that Rocket Launcher.  Here, now if you hold scope down after you've fired a rocket, you can guide it where you want it to go.  It's great for shooting around cover."
	"#str_303929"	"Kane! Over here!"
	"#str_303930"	"Careful, Kane."
	"#str_303931"	"Hold up there, Marine. Let me see your nail gun for a second."
	"#str_303932"	"Well done, Kane. I have almost finished my work here. Damn."
	"#str_303933"	"But I need protection, Lieutenant."
	"#str_303934"	"Corporal, check that tunnel. The shutoff to the forcefield might be in there."
	"#str_303935"	"What the hell's goin' on here?"
	"#str_303936"	"Wait. Listen."
	"#str_303937"	"Quick! Fire off the EMP!"
	"#str_303938"	"Almost there..."
	"#str_303939"	"Marines! Open fire!"
	"#str_303940"	"SHUT THE HELL UP, STRAUSS! Half the squad is dead, So why don't you just be quiet while we pick up the pieces?"
	"#str_303941"	"Ah, so you did survive. Ha, ha! I've won the bet with Rhodes."
	"#str_303942"	"Don't worry. You'll be fine. Here."
	"#str_303943"	"I gave him a medpack and sedated him. He'll be fine."
	"#str_303944"	"Contacts!"
	"#str_303945"	"This is H Q, Viper squad. Reinforcements E T A is 10 minutes."
	"#str_303946"	"H Q, the Strogg bunker has been tagged with a a targeting laser."
	"#str_303947"	"Direct hit, H Q! Target has been neutralized!"
	"#str_303948"	"Viper squad, this is H Q. Mantis squad is M I A and unresponsive. Fall back to rally point alpha niner four."
	"#str_303949"	"H Q, this is Bison Squad. Primary target has been nullified. We'd like to aid the infantry now."
	"#str_303950"	"Bison squad has been informed of your status."
	"#str_303951"	"H Q, H Q, this is Cougar Squad. We can't get to the Air Defense Cannon. The Strogg air support is too heavy!"
	"#str_303952"	"There's too many damn fliers. We can't get near."
	"#str_303953"	"Five... four... three... two... one..."
	"#str_303954"	"C'mon, Kane. Let's get going."
	"#str_303955"	"Let me patch your armor."
	"#str_303956"	"I will patch your armor for you."
	"#str_303957"	"{puzzled}Kovitch, what took you so long to get back?"
	"#str_303958"	"{scared}Kane."
	"#str_303959"	"{scared}They're stealing everything I know."
	"#str_303960"	"Kane! Is there some way to turn off this grid so we can get through?"
	"#str_303961"	"{puzzled}Wow, he was your L T? {scared}You had to do it man. {idle}If he'd lived, the Strogg would have gotten a lot of military secrets from him. C'mon, let's get the hell out of here."
	"#str_303962"	"Here, let me adjust your nailgun."
	"#str_303963"	"You're Kane, right?  My name's Anderson.  Here, let me heal you."
	"#str_303964"	"If you get hurt, find a medic, they'll heal you up."
	"#str_303965"	"Lead the way and let us see if we can find the Hub control room."
	"#str_303966"	"Now you can use the sight to zoom in on your targets and the nails will track them."
